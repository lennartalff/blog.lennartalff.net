## Why?

I have a domain and want to use different services with different subdomains. So for example I have a already running Nextcloud instance and want to add this Jekyll powered website.

## Status Quo

SSL certificates for my websites are generated by `certbot`. I have set up a `cron` job to renew my certificates

{% highlight sh %}
certbot renew --rsa-key-size 4096 --renew-hook "systemctl restart apache2"
{% endhighlight %}

To check for which domains I have certificates, I can run
{% highlight sh %}
sudo certbot certificates
{% endhighlight %}

I will need these information later when I add a domain for an existing certificate.
