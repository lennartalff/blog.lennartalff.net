## Why I prefer the official Kernel Module

At University I'm workin with small scale underwater robots. The vehicle estimates its position and orientation by applying a vision based pose estimation. Since there is not too much light in our test pool, we looked for an alternative to the official Raspberry Pi camera that uses an IMX219 image sensor. A more sensitive sensor allows for shorter exposure times and therefore minimizes motion blur. 

For roughly a year by now we have camera boards by Arducam in operation that are based on the OV9281 sensor. To be precise, these boards are exactly of the type shown in the figure below.

Arducam provides a closed-source library, and example code how to access the camera, on [GitHub](https://github.com/ArduCAM/MIPI_Camera). Actually there is not much wrong with using this library. At least if you don't mind that you are bound to Raspbian Buster (or Raspberry Pi OS as they call it now). Even a 64-bit version of the library is provided. So you can use the experimental 64-bit version of Raspbian that can be found in official [Raspberry Pi website](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/). But there seem to be [problems](https://github.com/ArduCAM/MIPI_Camera/issues/106) with the 64-bit version of the Arducam library.

I prefer to have more freedom regarding the choice of the operating system I'm going to use.
